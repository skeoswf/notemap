# notemap

an application tailored for both casual and professional musicians to create and view bands, organize their upcoming gigs, and connect with other musicians

notemap solves the problem of communication between musicians who 1) largely perform freelance, 2) is looking for fulfill a role (or roles) for a group, 3) is already in a group and is looking for members, or 4) is interested in creating a group. for the most part, outside of relatively niche online communities and local networking, it can be hard for the average musician to socially connect for the sole purpose of performance

notemap was developed by skeo as his frontstone capstone during his time at nashville software school
